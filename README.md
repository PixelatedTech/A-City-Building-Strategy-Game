# A-City-Building-Strategy-Game
Welcome to Simp City, where you, the mayor, have one goal: build and manage a thriving metropolis. 
But it’s not as simple as it sounds—strategy, planning, and some serious decision-making are key to turning the city into a vibrant, prosperous hub. Ready to build? Let’s see what you’ve got!

About This Project
Simp City is a city-building strategy game that challenges players to strategically place buildings on a 4x4 grid. 
Over 16 turns, you’ll make crucial decisions on where to build your beachfronts, factories, houses, and more. 
Your goal: maximise your city's happiness and prosperity by building in the right locations, creating connections between structures, and managing resources effectively.

This project was developed as part of my Programming 1 (PRG1) assignment at Ngee Ann Polytechnic. 
It's a perfect combination of strategy, game design, and Python programming—all wrapped up in one fun package.

Why I Built This:
I wanted to create a simple yet engaging project that combines both programming and game design. Simp City is a fun way to explore how algorithms and logic can create dynamic, interactive experiences.
